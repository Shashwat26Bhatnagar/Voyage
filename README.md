# VirtuVoyage  
**Tagline: Smart trips. Seamless days.**

üìå *Submission for the Google Maps Platform Hackathon on Devpost.*

VirtuVoyage was developed to simplify and personalize the way people plan their trips and explore monuments. The application revolves around two core features: intelligent itinerary generation and immersive virtual tours. The goal was to reduce the manual effort typically involved in organizing day-wise schedules across cities while enhancing how people interact with historical information.

To start, users select monuments they are interested in visiting, and VirtuVoyage takes care of generating a complete itinerary. We categorized each day of the trip into one of three types: full-day monument visits, intra-city travel with multiple locations, and inter-city travel. A custom clustering algorithm combining K-Means and DBSCAN was designed to group monuments based on proximity and visit time while flagging potential outliers. To optimize the order of visits within each cluster, we applied Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm to determine the shortest and most efficient route. The resulting schedule is then passed to Gemini Pro 2.5, which converts the raw sequence into a coherent, user-friendly itinerary in natural language.

The second major feature of VirtuVoyage focuses on interactive virtual tours. These tours are built using 360-degree panoramic images of monuments, guided by a conversational assistant that offers both narration and live Q&A. The assistant is powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Gemini Flash 2.5, ensuring responses are accurate and grounded in real-world facts. To create lifelike narration, we used ElevenLabs to generate voices with specific tones and accents. The script for each monument tour was generated using Gemini 3 (12B multimodal), allowing for rich descriptions that match the visual content. For fast and contextually accurate search within the assistant, we utilized Faiss as a vector database for semantic search.

Currently, the platform features tours for three major monuments, but we built the backend to support rapid expansion. We designed it with modularity and scalability in mind, making it easy to add new content and features in the future.

Throughout development, we faced challenges such as tuning clustering algorithms for mixed travel patterns, maintaining factual accuracy across AI responses, and integrating various third-party services smoothly. Despite the technical complexity, VirtuVoyage reflects a vision where AI not only simplifies decision-making but also makes cultural exploration more engaging, educational, and accessible.
